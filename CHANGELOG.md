## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- `/ps:jira-summary`: image attachment analysis via Gemini Vision API
  - `fetch_jira.py` now fetches `attachment` field and returns `attachments[]` (image files only)
  - New `analyze_jira_images.py` — downloads each image attachment using Jira auth, sends to `gemini-2.0-flash`, returns `{filename, description}[]`
  - Skill adds **Step 3.5** to run image analysis when attachments are present; results included in summary as **Images** section
  - Gracefully skipped when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not set
- `fetch_jira.py`: `extract_text` now renders `mediaSingle`/`mediaInline` ADF nodes as `[image: alt]` placeholder instead of silently dropping them

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-29

### Removed
- `/ps:slack-login` command — no longer needed, tokens auto-extracted from Slack desktop app

### Changed
- `check_slack_tokens.sh`: auto-extract from Slack desktop app storage first (LevelDB), then fallback to saved file, then manual F12 instructions
- `get_slack_tokens.py`: added Linux Snap and Flatpak storage paths, fixed WSL detection for Windows username

- `render_excalidraw.py` + `render_template.html` renderer using `@excalidraw/excalidraw` ESM CDN
- `setup.sh` for one-time Playwright + Chromium install
- Fixed remote install to preserve subdirectory structure under `scripts/`
